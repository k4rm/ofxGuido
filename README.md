GUIDO Engine musical score renderer layer for OpenFrameworks

ofxGuido is a simple super-class for drawing scores rendered by the GUIDO Engine
library: http://guidolib.sourceforge.net/

openFrameworks GUDIO backend Copyright (C) 2012 Grame

ofxGuido was made in February 2014 by Thomas Coffy as a part of Ascograph,
the graphical score editor for Antescofo: http://repmus.ircam.fr/mutant/ascograph

Updated in 2019 by Dan Wilcox for tests at the ZKM | Hertz-Lab

Requirements
------------

* libSGUIDOEngine
* gudio2.tff installed on the system

Building
--------

The GUIDO Engine header files and static library are required to build ofxGuido.
These are currently included for macOS but the static lib will need to be built
for other platforms.

### Building GUIDO Engine

For macOS or Linux, you can use the included shell script to automate the
process:

    scripts/update_guido.sh

To do this manually, clone the source files and build for your platform:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/grame-cncm/guidolib
cd guidolib
mkdir -p build/platform
cd build/platform
cmake ../cmake -DSTATICLIB=yes
make
~~~

For Windows, the GUIDOEngine docs recommend building with Visual Studio,
so the Visual Studio project files will need to be generated by CMake instead
of using Unix Makefiles.

This will result in a libSGUDIOEngine static library in the `build/lib`
directory which can be placed in the appropriate platform subdirectory within
`lib/guidolib/lib`, ie. for 64-bit Linux64:

~~~
cd /path/to/cloned/guidolib
mkdir -p /path/to/openframeworks/addons/ofxGuido/lib/guidolib/lib/linux64
cp lib/libSGUIDOEngine.a /path/to/openframeworks/addons/ofxGuido/lib/guidolib/lib/linux64     
~~~

*Note: For Windows, the static library will be named libSGUDIOEngine.lib and
there may be an additional .dll which needs to be placed in your projects bin
directory.*

You should now be able to use the OF ProjectGenerator app to create an OF
project using ofxGuido which will link the pre-build lib.

If the lib is not found by the linker, you may need to add an `ADDON_LIBS` line
to your platform target in addon_config.mk and re-run the ProjectGenerator.

### Updating Headers

If the GUIDO Engine headers also need to be updated, copy them from the cloned
guidolib directory to `libs/guidolib/include`:

~~~
cp ../../src/engine/include/* /path/to/openframeworks/addons/ofxGuido/lib/guidolib/include
~~~

Running
-------

GUDIO Engine requires two fonts:

* Times New Roman: score text, should be included on the system
* guido2.ttf: score notation, must be installed on the system

Make sure you install gudio2.ttf on your system, it can be found in:

    libs/guidolib/res
